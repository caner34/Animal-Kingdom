A Brief Introduction To The Project


Animal Kingdom is an animal guessing game.

Contrary to expectations, the party to guess the animal is the application itself rather than human player(s).

 	From this point of view, the main actor is the human player and the app can be categorized as the supporting actor.

The data stored in arrays are processed and sorted in a custom array list and the tree structure is filled with nodes which also includes Animal objects as one of its fields.



The binary decision tree contains questions or animal answers based on its function.
The tree nodes with questions are employed to point to the animal in user’s mind.

The questions reveal the nature of the animals, usually the characteristics related to its class or family as well as its phenotypic appearance.


Animal Kingdom is developed as a cross-platform mobile app based on Flutter Framework. 
The application is written in Dart which quite correlates with C family and Java in terms of both syntax and semantics. And flutter has also major similarities with the mobile development frameworks and sdks out there which the developer has a grasp of. So it was not the invention of the wheel for him, even it was the first time within this environment.





One of the important qualities of Animal Kingdom is its ability to be able to improve itself over time.

Even the guessed animal is not the one as in the user’s mind. Animal Kingdom asks for users contribution and enriches its repertoire even wider and wider according as it is played.

In that manner, we can easily infer that it has an active set of stem cells.
